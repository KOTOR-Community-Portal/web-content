# How to Contribute

## Getting Started

You'll need a GitHub account to contribute to the KOTOR Community Portal. If you don't already have one, you can [sign up](https://github.com/join) for free.

## Making Changes

All [contributions to this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) are released under a [free culture license](/LICENSE).

### On GitHub

The easiest way to contribute is to edit content directly in your browser using GitHub's web editor.

1. Go to the file you want to edit on GitHub.
2. Click the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the file view to edit the file.
3. GitHub will ask you to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository. This will create a copy of the repository on your account.
4. Make whatever changes you want.
5. Add a a meaningful commit message explaining what you changed.
6. Click the `Propose file change` to save your changes.
8. You'll be presented with the option to `Create a pull request`. A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way of proposing changes to a repository's maintainers. Any changes you make on your forked repository will not affect the original repository unless you submit a pull request.
9. GitHub will automatically generate a summary of the pull request for you to review. While you don't need to change any options here, this is where you'll find out if the merge is possible. If you see any error messages, it means there are issues that need to be addressed before your changes can be merged.
10. Click the "Create pull request" button to formally submit your proposal.
17. Wait for our team to review your changes. Then, one of the following will happen:
    - We will accept your proposal as is
    - We will accept your proposal, but we will ask you to make some changes before publishing
    - We will not accept your proposal, but we will explain why

### Locally

If you would like to make changes on your local machine, you can [clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and work offline. GitHub provides two applications to simplify working with Git and GitHub repositories: 

- [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (graphical user interface)
- [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli) (command-line interface)

It is also possible to [set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) with other command-line tools.

## Branches

We use [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) to manage changes to the KOTOR Community Portal website. A branch is a separate line of development for making changes without affecting the main project.

- The **main** branch will typically contain the current working version of the website. The main branch is protected, so only certain users are able to edit it. Generally, the main branch will be changed only when a new version of the website is published.
- The **default** branch will typically contain a work in progress of the next version. Typically, this branch will be named whatever the next version of the website is going to be named.
- Other branches may be used for developing individual features.

Most of the time, you will only need to worry about the default branch.

In GitHub's web editor, you can switch branches using the dropdown menu located at the top left of each page.
