# Frequently Asked Questions

Our FAQ is an incredibly expansive and robust set of community-sourced questions and answers of all sorts, from troubleshooting to mechanics questions, character builds and modding. Because the guide is so expansive, it will be split into three sections: this page will include the general questions regarding the game, whereas the [KOTOR](/faq/k1.html), [KOTOR 2](/faq/k2.html), and [Lore Questions](/faq/lore.html) categories will all be split into their own separate wiki pages, to help aid in navigability.

We would like to take a moment to thank all of our users for submitting their questions and answers from back when this FAQ was still in [Compendium format](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/70f30d/rkotor_compendium_questions_of_all_kinds_answered/)â€”we've had to remove and streamline a lot of the excess answers in the process of migrating to the wiki format, but without everyone's past contributions, we wouldn't have as excellent a resource as we now do!

If you have any additional suggestions for the FAQ, including new questions or edits to answers, feel free to make post on the subreddit or [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fkotor) about it!
