# Buying the KOTOR Games

## KOTOR

### PC

PLEASE NOTE: Though the Steam version of KOTOR comes with support for the Steam overlay, the executable for the Steam version of the game is encrypted, which prevents patching the game to a resolution higher than the game's native maximum (1280x1024) without replacing the executable file with an editable version. This is relatively easy, and links to modding executables are available safely through DeadlyStream.com (the main KOTOR modding site), but this may still be a consideration for you.

The KOTOR games often go on a major sale during most Steam sale events, and especially on the general Star Wars sale around May 4^th^.

## KOTOR II - The Sith Lords

### PC

**NOTE:** Recently KOTOR 2 received an update on Steam & GOG which added native controller and widescreen support. While this seems helpful, it's unfortunately caused several other problems: lightsaber hilt texture mods don't function with the new version, some effects like fog have been removed, save games are sometimes lost temporarily, it can cause or exacerbate issues with in-game dialogue skipping, and rarely users experience extreme and irreparable stuttering and screen tear.

Most of these problems are fixable, or at least have workarounds. For example, to ensure saves aren't lost, disable cloud saves; to re-enable fog in the game, install [this git](https://github.com/HappyFunTimes01/ShaderOverride/blob/master/README.md) by following the [steps here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/comments/67578l/aspyr_wont_patch_the_fog_on_dxun_but_a_fan_made/); and to fix skipping dialogue, simply restart the game. With that said, there is no workaround for using lightsaber hilt textures that doesn't break the game, and none at all for the rare irreparable stuttering, without reverting the patch.

If you purchase the Steam version and encounter issues significant enough to require reverting versions, the process is quite easy: for Steam, navigate to KOTOR 2 in your Steam library, right-click and select properties, go to Betas and opt in to the "legacypc" beta; for GOG you must be using the GOG Galaxy launcher, go to the game's options in GOG Galaxy, then Manage Installation, then Configure, and you can switch to the old version. If you then wish to re-apply support for widescreen resolutions above 1280x1024, you can follow the instructions presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSiVC92dJHI). By using UniWS, you also avoid many of the issues caused by FlawlessWidescreen, including savegame corruption.

Following the application of basic widescreen support, if you would like additional widescreen support mods (including high-resolution cutscenes), or if you've ever had the fullscreen bug (game crashing when playing cutscenes), see [**here**](/r/kotor/wiki/k2hiressupport) for additional mods and methods which can improve widescreen and fix the fullscreen bug.
